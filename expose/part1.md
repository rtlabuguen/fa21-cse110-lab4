2. final result: 20
3. values added: 20
4. error, variable "result" is declared in the scope of the if statement, thus does not exist in line 13
5. error, in line 7, there was an attempt to change the value of the variable "result", but "result" is a const and cannot be changed
6. error, same as question 5 as well as the fact that line 13 is trying to call the variable "result" outside of scope
